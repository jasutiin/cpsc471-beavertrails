## beavertrails backend B)

canadian travel app B)

### how to run

1. `cd backend` assuming you're in the beavertrails directory
2. `node server.js` to run the server

idk how else to test the api endpoints but how i did it was download postman, put localhost:8080/{api-endpoint} and then press Send. there might be another way to do it tho
