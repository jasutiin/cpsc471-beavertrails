## prerequisites

- have node.js on your computer
- have git on your computer

### setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/jasutiin/cpsc471-beavertrails.git` to clone repository into your computer
2. `cd cpsc471-beavertrails/backend` to go to backend directory
3. `npm i` to install libraries inside the backend directory
4. `node server.js` to run the server
5. in a separate terminal, `cd cpsc471-beavertrails/frontend` to go to frontend directory
6. `npm i` to install libraries inside the frontend directory
7. if step 6 doesn't work then do `npm i --force` it's ok i tried it and it worked :)
8. `npm run dev` to run the client
9. click on the link that pops up in that terminal to open up a browser window with the application

note that for step 4, you need a .env file which has all the information for the database. since it is in the .gitignore file, it won't be here initially when you clone the repo. ask me for the .env file and i'll be happy to provide it :)
