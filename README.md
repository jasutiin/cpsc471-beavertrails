canadian travel app B)

### setup

1. `git clone https://github.com/jasutiin/cpsc471-beavertrails.git` to clone repository into your computer
2. `cd cpsc471-beavertrails/backend` to go to backend directory
3. `npm i` to install libraries
4. `node --env-file .env ./server.js` to run the server and database

note that for step 4, you need a .env file which has all the information for the database. since it is in the .gitignore file, it won't be here initially when you clone the repo. ask me for the .env file and i'll be happy to provide it :)
